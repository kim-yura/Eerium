      content: `I moved about 4hrs away from my home town for college and stay here to date. Every time i want to visit my parents, i will leave on friday night after work, make sure i reach them at late night. Atleast i have the full Saturday with them before i drive back to city on Sunday evening. Unfortunately it gets pretty tiring driving after week long work.

      One day, i was just too tired to drive. I know i should not rush and should get some rest before continue driving. Despite multiple stops to get some shut eye, drank coffees and energy drinks, I'm just too tired to continue.

      Until come to a point I'm about 1.5hrs away from my home town. I stopped at a petrol station, drove to the side where there were less lighting and tried to get some good sleep before continue driving. This place has less lighting because it was close to forest along the highway. There i had this weird dream.

      I was actually still sleeping on my chair in the dream. But it was inside a bus and the person sitting next to me woke me up to talk with me. We were talking about normal stuff for a short while. Then comes the weird part, he wanted to show me some photos. While going thru the photos, there was one photo of me sleeping INSIDE MY CAR. The photo was taken from the passenger seat. I asked him how he got the photo? His smiling face turned very angry. Like VERY angry.

      The dream reverted back to my car by now. I'm seated to driver seat, that person on passenger seat from where the photo taken.

      Now i asked him what is he doing in my car? He asked me back "I'm asking you the same, what are you doing in my place?!" This time i woke up to reality.

      I didn't say a single word. wide awake now, just drove back to home town without a single stop. My fastest 1hr drive ever in that road.

      After few years, i was telling my close friend about this weird dream. When he asked me where was it, i told him "remember when we were driving last time, you had a leg cramp and swerved your car 180° and hit the divider? About 50m from there."

      My friend's face now turned pale and he said. "My leg was not cramped that day. I saw something weird running across and tried to avoid it. I lied back then because when i looked back, that thing was not there. I was scared, confused and i could not figure out what was that."`,

    title: `I stayed in a haunted house in Warwick and I swear it was evil.`,
    category: `haunted houses`,
    content: `When I was pregnant, me and my kids father stayed at his cousins house for about a month before we moved into our apartment. It’s an old farm house in a newly developed area of Warwick, Rhode Island. There are farms and woods in one direction and a small town on the other.

    We were told when we moved in, that the house had been built in the mid 1800s, which to me was super interesting until my kids father (I’ll call him Bryan) remarked at how the stairs seemed awfully dark and creepy for the middle of the day and when I looked, he was right. It gave off such a sinister vibe. We slept in the living room and at night could see through the kitchen and it was as if the stairs became a dark uncomfortable void. When we brought this up to Bryan’s cousin and his wife, they proceeded to laugh and tell us stories of people being pushed down the stairs (I don’t think they believed in ghosts and the husband was an abusive drunk and drug addict..so they had enough problems clearly.)

    That house was chaotic. The husband and wife clearly were having serious issues, emotionally and financially. They had a 6 year old son who was afraid to sleep upstairs by himself because “the shadows” scared him. Great. After being in the house alone a couple times and seeing genuine human figures out of the corner of my eye. Or even better, black dots on the floor with what looked like long spindly legs running but when you’d look at them straight on, would disappear. A few times I would see a figure out of the corner of my eye, look and see one of the family members who I hadn’t heard come in. I think that freaked me out the most because how can you explain to yourself seeing a person and sometimes nothing being there but other times you expect it to disappear but would in fact, be a person standing there this time. So weird.

    Bryan would say how sitting in one chair in the living room you’d want to look over your shoulder into the doorway, as if someone was coming down a set of stairs that’s used to be there. This also freaked me out, considering I slept right near the doorway and often would get a feeling of someone coming toward me. One day me and Bryan were the only two in the entire house. Facing one another about two feet away face to face, talking loud as we usually do. Directly in the middle of us we heard a woman’s voice say “SHHH!”. I asked if he had said that and he stared at me with huge eyes and asked “no? Did you?” Then we laughed it off as we were clearly talking too loud for the inhabitants, apparently.

    We eventually brought this up to the family (who included a second cousin living upstairs) and they confirmed they too saw and felt things. They told us they assumed the black voids that ran on the floor were just one of their dogs and ignored it if it wasn’t. The cousin who lived upstairs said the curtains to his closet often moved like they were being pushed but he chocked it up to being stoned or tired. There was no breeze.

    The wife told me when they first moved there, her son would see “a man in a hat” but assumed it was his imagination. How could you live in a house so clearly haunted and just pass it off? The front of the house at night was avoided by basically everyone, as it was right where it felt like someone was walking by the doorframe at you in the living room. One night I didn’t feel like walking all the way around this huge house to the car, so I walked as fast as I could to the car through the front door. I heard a deep growling coming from the side of the house. They owned three dogs, one of which was a bull mastiff. Too freaked out to call for her, I ran in and to my horror all three dogs were in the house. Needless to say I didn’t use that entrance again.

    It was such an emotionally depressing house, and maybe me being pregnant I was just more aware of everything? There were other weird things but one of the last conversations I had with one of the roommates renting a back bedroom (it was down a long hall at the very end, the only door in this isolated hallway). I told her about me and Bryan hearing “SHH!” Directly in the middle of us. She explained she hears the same exact thing in the hallway, if she and her son were getting loud, but was sure it was the owners young son sneaking into the hallway. I’m not so sure.

    Edit: I said late 1800’s. I asked the home owner to clarify, it was actually built in the 1840’s.`,

  content: `I have two younger sisters. I wanted to share a story we share that is still brought up in my family today and regarded with fear.

  When we were kids I had my own room. My two little sisters had to share theirs, and one night we thought it would be fun to trade rooms. I was around 11, they were 8 and 7. We'll call them Kate (8) and Alice (7).

  We set up our blankets and pillows in each other's beds, Kate slept on the floor next to Alice on my bed. I fell asleep alone in their room and all was well. But the next morning something seemed wrong. My sisters looked terrified and said they never wanted to trade rooms again. I asked them why not?

  Apparently they had stayed up very late, chatting and giggling with each other (probably joking about farts, if I know them) when Kate had suddenly gone silent. Alice turned over in the bed and saw what she described as "a very tiny man with a head like a sideways football." She said it was standing in the doorway looking back at them. It just stared for a few moments and they were too scared to respond.

  Finally, it took some steps towards them and Kate freaked out. "She threw her pillow at it" Alice said, "And it ran away."

  It's hard to get more details from them, because as we grew older Kate became estranged from the family and Alice remembers it, but is still too afraid to talk about it. It still makes me shake because they both saw it and their reactions were not at all typical of their behavior. And I have to wonder...why was it coming into my room?

  TLDR; My sisters see a tiny monster in my bedroom one night when we trade beds.`,
